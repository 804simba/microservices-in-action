# DATABASE

Differences between No-SQL and SQL databases
## 1. Data Model:
    SQL databases uses a structured tabular data model, where data is organized in rows and columns in tables.
    While, NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, including document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.

## 2. Schema:
    SQL databases have a fixed schema, thus the structure of the data has to be predefined, while NoSQL databases
    have a flexible or dynamic schema, thus the structure of the data can change over time.

## 3. ACID principles:
    SQL databases support ACID principles, while NoSQL databases may or may not support ACID principles depending on the
    specific database and the data model being used.
## 4. Use cases:
    SQL databases are well-suited for structured, transactional data and are often used in applications such as
    financial systems, HR applications, and ecommerce applications. While NoSQL databases are suitable for unstructured,
    large scale data and are often used in applications such as real-time analytics, social networking, content management etc.


## Factors to consider for choosing between SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Define the requirements: Work out the needs of your app and the type of data you would be handling.
- Consider your data model: Figure out the structure of your data, and how it will be stored and accessed.
